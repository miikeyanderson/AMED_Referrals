Design a responsive referral submission form using React and Tailwind CSS, focused on the needs of clinicians. The form must include:

1. **Form Fields:**
   - Colleague Name: Text input with character limit (100) and error handling for empty fields.
   - Colleague Email: Email input with real-time validation for proper format.
   - Colleague Phone Number: Number input with formatting for US phone numbers and a validation message for incorrect formats.
   - Certifications: Multi-select dropdown or checkbox group for certifications like BLS, ACLS, etc., fetched dynamically from the `/api/certifications` endpoint.
   - Preferred Start Date: Date picker with constraints (no past dates).
   - Notes (Optional): Text area for additional comments about the referral.

2. **Document Upload Section:**
   - Allow up to three files to be uploaded (e.g., resume, certifications, COVID card).
   - Display uploaded files with:
     - File name and size.
     - Option to delete or replace files.
     - Validation for file types (PDF, JPEG, PNG) and size (max 5MB per file).
   - Use a drag-and-drop interface with a fallback file input for accessibility.

3. **Progress Tracker:**
   - Use a horizontal step progress bar to indicate steps:
     - **Referral Details** → **Document Upload** → **Review & Submit.**
   - Update progress dynamically as each step is completed.

4. **Submit Button:**
   - Initially disabled; becomes active when all required fields are valid.
   - Show a loading spinner during form submission.
   - Provide clear feedback on success or failure (e.g., toast notifications).

5. **Error Handling and UX Enhancements:**
   - Real-time field validation with error messages below invalid fields.
   - Display backend errors (e.g., file upload failure) clearly and actionable.

6. **Design:**
   - Use a professional healthcare theme with Tailwind CSS (blue and white palette).
   - Ensure a mobile-first, responsive layout with accessible elements.

7. **Integration:**
   - On form submission, send a POST request to `/api/referrals`.
   - Use React Query to handle loading states and errors gracefully.
   - Add a success confirmation screen with the referral summary and tracking link.

Files to Modify:
- `client/src/components/dashboard/clinician/ReferralForm.tsx`: Create the referral form.
- `client/src/components/ui`: Use existing form, button, and input components.

Testing Requirements:
- Validate all field constraints and error messages.
- Test responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Simulate file uploads to ensure they meet validation criteria.
